                <h3>Learning Efficiently</h3>
                <p>Failure is a universal experience. Being able to fail is being able to learn, and there is nothing
                    that makes you feel quite as helpless as programming. Due to this, countless people find themselves
                    asking the same questions over and over again, wondering when they'll finally feel ready enough to
                    actually get down to the <b>programming</b> part of programming.</p>
                <p>Learning how to program, unfortunately, requires you to program. This monolothic task feels
                    impossible at first, and will feel just as hard later. Very few people are innately talented
                    programmers, but there are many skills that most people possess that can be used to program. The
                    main skill for any programmer is what most people refer to as 'learning to think like a programmer',
                    or Computational-thinking <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf" />[7]</a>.
                    Learning to think like a programmer in its simplest terms means learning how to think like a
                    computer. This mindset
                    change takes time, and will be something any programmer will internalize with enough practice.</p>
                <p>
                    An important aspect of programming, and perhaps most things involving learning, is the effectiveness
                    of group learning.
                    Being able to collaborate with others demonstrates positive effects in relation to testing and
                    longterm retention of concepts<a

                </p>
                <h3>Gamification</h3>
                <p>Personally, I have found gamified semantics and other gamified programming aspects to be the most
                    effective methods of learning.
                    There are many websites (ie. <a href="https://www.codewars.com">codewars</a>) that use game-like
                    interfaces and activities to stimulate
                    learning and keep attention on the subject. There are also more straightforward games, such as <a
                        href=https://reduct-game.github.io/play />Reduct</a><a
                        href=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/reduct-chi17/reduct-chi17.pdf>[3]</a>, built to work
                    as a bridge between gaming concepts and programming problems. Gamification
                    as a way to learn is something that many companies and people are using as an effective
                    and proven method of teaching. Gamified semantics help break down the conceptual barriers, allowing
                    players to directly
                    interact and discover coding concepts through trial and error, an effective method for coding in the
                    first place. Gamified semantics for learning programming have noted effects such as increased
                    recall, recognition, and transference of programming concepts.<a
                        href=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/papers/reduct-chi17/reduct-chi17.pdf>[3]</a>
                    Coding lends itself to 'gamifying' very well, and many people in the field are already interested in
                    games so it's not hard to find
                    something that works for you, no matter what level you find yourself at.
