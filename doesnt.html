                    First things first, why is programming so hard?
                </h3>
                <p>It's not a secret that introductory programming courses have an inordinately high failure rate <a

                    Programming is something that you truly have to be open to learning. There isn't a fast or easy way
                    to learn, there is simply THE way to learn (which is constant practice). This simple reality is the
                    cornerstone of the issue with learning programming: it's one thing to want to know how to program,
                    it's another thing to know what it even means to program. Learning from researchers, we can see that
                    a major problem is the lack of fundamentals in the early stages and lack of understanding of what to
                    learn and understand. Programming fundamentals
                    don't generally come naturally, and these cognitive skills need to be taught early and reinforced to make a difference for a beginner programmer<a
                    href=https://www.cedtech.net/download/factors-contributing-to-the-difficulties-in-teaching-and-learning-of-computer-programming-a-8247.pdf>[6]</a>. We can also see the effectiveness of various interventions on pass
                    rates, and from this we can extrapolate the
                    effectiveness of these and possibly implement them in our own routine. Self study is the key to
                    learning anything, and truly learning programming
                    requires you to develop yourself a routine that keeps your skills honed and imagination keen.
                    Dedication will pay off, but it's hard to be dedicated when you feel helpless.</p>

                    So... what doesn't work?
                </h3>
                <p>Traditional teaching methods don't generally seem to work for computer science learning<a
                    href=https://www.cedtech.net/download/factors-contributing-to-the-difficulties-in-teaching-and-learning-of-computer-programming-a-8247.pdf>[6]</a>. Programming concepts benefit
                    from live demonstrations, detailed explanations, immediate feedback, and engagement. Static materials, such as worksheets or textbooks,
                    dont prioritize this active learning that is required to learn programming. Students may work better or worse in dynamic learning environments,
                    or maybe would prefer self study. The lack of manpower in schools and misunderstandings of dynamic teaching methods are a major downfall
                    of current learning. This is why it's important to understand what is effective for learning, and to try your best to 
                    incorporate and understand why these methods are effective.
                </p>
                <p>What you should really take away from this is that learning how to program is a unique experience. Going 
                    into this experience with an open mind, and as much resources as possible, is the least you can do to be prepared.
