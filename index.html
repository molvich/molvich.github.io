                <h2>Some need to know terms:</h2>
                <h3>Gamification: <h4><i>The process of adding games or gamelike elements to something (such as a task)
                            so as to encourage participation. </i><a
                            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gamification">[1]</a></h4>
                </h3>

                <h3>Computational-thinking: <h4><i>The thought processes involved in formulating problems so their
                            solutions can be represented as computational steps and algorithms. Foundational for
                            understanding how to program.</i></h4>
                </h3>

                <h3>
                    Computer Science:<h4><i>A branch of science that deals with the theory of computation or the design
                            of computers. </i><a
                            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/computer science">[1]</a>
                        <p>Notably, computer science is NOT programming, or coding. Computer science is a
                            multidisciplinary field requiring a wide skillset and understanding of computers.
                    </h4>
                    </p>
                </h3>

                <h1>My background</h1>
                <p>I've been trying to learn programming for a good part of the past 5 or so years. In that
                    time, I've realized there are a lot of ways to convince yourself that you're doing the right thing.
                    For me, the most important thing was realizing what works in helping me learn, what doesn't work,
                    and most importantly what methods I could use to continue to teach myself new things. There are
                    technically no right or wrong ways to learn, as long as you are trying your best and open to change.
                    These are just a few ways I've found to be effective.</p>
